# TFG
This repository contains in simulations the necessary codes to perform the SUMO simulations with a predefined cases.
It also contains the programs used to analyze the data obtained.

## Simulations
(this doesn't work yet, it is in process)
All the files must be executed having as working directory the simulations folder. 
* The file **stationary.py** (more explained at **stationary.ipynb**) executes all the simulations of the stationary scenarios, that are * needed to know the measurements obtained on these situations.
* The file **non_stationary.py** (more explained at **non_stationary.ipynb**) executes all the simulations for the non stationary scenarios, that are the ones used to test the classification method designed. 

## Data analysis


## Requierements
You need to have installed SUMO (Simulation for Urban Mobility), Python and R.
